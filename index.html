				This paper will examine bureaucracy together with the avant-garde art of the XX century. This will be done via the conceptualization of the division into Apollonian and Dionysian principles, as a method to put these opposite ideas on the same surface and in this way equate them. Examples of artistic methods of defamiliarization, will be given as experiments in grasping the Deleuzian concept of flow. Thus, by not looking at it as a dichotomy but rather as an oscillating movement, in a constant state of exposing one and another. It will be important to mention that the bureaucracy will be considered in the period of the technogenic society, because according to Weber, the industrialized society of modernity provides the soil for the full potential of the bureaucratic system. The character of the mass, and the total bureaucratization, leads to the personal disintegration which becomes the focus of the artists to create new ways of living and seeing. </p>
