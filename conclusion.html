    <p>Regarding the flow, we are still within the European paradigm and still identify cognition with representation. The very division into Apollonian and Dionysian is itself Apollonian. We can always imagine specific points of the “now” of matter, but we can never conceive of this movement itself, the process itself. Filonov brings us closer to the flow philosophy of Deleuze. But we cannot embody this Deleuzean utopia, we cannot become this flow, we cannot imagine it. It is obvious that any dissatisfaction, any attempt tied to action, is taken into account by the “map”. The “map” is absorbent, it does not need to fight the enemy, it absorbs it and builds it into its body.</p>
    <p>Going back to this tax on trash, perhaps this is where the very defamiliarization lies. Language is like zaum- defamiliarization. If in zaum the word and letter renounce meanings and descriptions, thereby freeing themselves from traditional language and perception in the name of the effect of estrangement and a new vision, then in officialese the same thing happens but in the opposite way. That is, the use of specific theses and nomenclature, an abundance of complex phrases, thereby deforms colloquial speech and literary style. Such speech is used in documents to avoid ambiguity, to make the information as clear as possible. Complete instrumentalism and instructionality, which, as stated earlier, is also successive to constructivism. Thanks to this, the same formalistic estrangement occurs. Thus, bureaucratic formalism is obtained. Unwillingly, this trash tax because my own ‘dyr bul shyl’. It is here where the curtain rises, and the flow is revealed, albeit for a brief moment.</p>
